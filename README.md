## Healthcheck

For debugging health checks, the Docker inspect command lets you view the output of commands that succeed or fail (here in JSON format):

```docker inspect e61 | jq ".[].State.Health" ```
* please install jq on your machine

Or run :
```docker inspect --format='{{json .State.Health}}' your-container-name```
